**The Stormhalter Project** is an `open community` with a goal to `recreate, improve, and expand` the traditional game-mechanics from Legends of Kesmai. We are currently in an **alpha release** and providing access to a few limited testers. We are currently focusing on: `Combat, Spells, and the land of Kesmai`. Characters created during the `alpha` and `beta` release will not be available when `live`.

Our server/client is independent of other projects, is written in `C#/MonoGame`, and is `closed-source`. We currently support: `Windows 7 & 10`.
